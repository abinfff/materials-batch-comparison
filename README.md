# Statistical Comparison of Material Batches

## Problem
Two production batches of a material were compared to evaluate whether a change in processing conditions affected yield strength.

## Methodology
- Simulated yield strength data for two batches
- Welch’s t-test to account for unequal variances
- 95% confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty
- Boxplot visualization to assess variability and overlap

## Key Results
- Batch B shows a higher mean yield strength than Batch A
- Statistical significance assessed using p-value
- Distribution overlap indicates variability, suggesting additional testing may be beneficial

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- SciPy (statistics)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates how statistical methods can support engineering decisions while accounting for experimental uncertainty.
